# BolMan
V 1.0 of BolMan

BolMan is a simplified version of pac-man
I don't own pac-man and am only uploading this to showcase my developer progression

This the first version of the mini game I made while learning frontend development
During this project I learned how to manipulate the DOM with Javascript

I made utilised different inbuilt methods like Array.forEach(), setTimeout(), Math.random() and much more
These helped me to come to creative solutions of problems I encountered while making this game
As a way of good practise, I put some of my functions into a separate folder. This makes the index.js file easier to read

Feel free to give suggestions or feedback. I am planning on updating the styling on a later date to make it look appealing
Currently, this serves as a proof of concept. the monsters have slight smart movements. they target your current location and keep chasing you
Perhaps in the future I'll add a BFS algorithm or just change the monster cage slightly. So leaving the cage might become easier for them
